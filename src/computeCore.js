//tree. It is usefull to think in terms of mutually recursive
//relations between two core process where the shared state is the
//data object . Where Core Compute seeks from and while Core Model
//populates from. The Core Model ask to find a data failing which it
//will trigger a computation. ? Need to think should the computation
//should happen in Core Engine or Core Model . I think it should still
//be in Core Model since that is where the definitions are usually
